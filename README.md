📌 Applied Data Science (ADS) Project
🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains an Applied Data Science (ADS) project focused on Market Basket Analysis and Customer Segmentation using Python and PySpark. We analyze a grocery store dataset to extract valuable insights about customer purchasing behavior through descriptive and predictive analytics.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover shopping trends
✔️ Association Rule Mining (Apriori, FP-Growth, AClose) for frequent itemsets
✔️ Predictive Modeling with Classification & Clustering techniques
✔️ Big Data Processing with PySpark for scalability

📄 ADS_PROJECT.ipynb - Colab.pdf – Jupyter Notebook with data analysis & ML models

📊 Project Breakdown
🟢 Descriptive Analytics (EDA & Visualization)
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering
Visualization Techniques:
📊 Bar Charts & Treemaps → Sales distribution by product categories
📅 Time-Series Analysis → Monthly & yearly sales trends
🎯 Customer Segmentation → Frequency distribution using Violin & Box plots
🟠 Predictive Analytics (ML Techniques)
1️⃣ Market Basket Analysis (Association Rule Mining)

Apriori, FP-Growth, and AClose algorithms
Frequent itemset mining to find co-purchased items
📌 Example: If a customer buys yogurt, they often buy whole milk
2️⃣ Classification Models (Customer Behavior Prediction)

Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3️⃣ Clustering (Customer Segmentation)

DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Hierarchical (AGNES)
4️⃣ Big Data Processing (PySpark Implementation)

Scalability: Optimized for large datasets
Speed: Faster processing of association rules & clustering
📈 Key Findings & Business Impact
✅ Top-selling items: Whole milk, vegetables, soda
✅ Peak sales days: Thursdays have the highest transactions
✅ Customer groups: Browsing (21%), Regular (70%), Loyal (9%)
✅ Marketing Insights:

Promote combo deals (e.g., milk + bread)
Offer discounts for loyal customers
Optimize inventory for peak seasons
