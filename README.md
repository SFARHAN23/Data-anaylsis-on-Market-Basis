📌 Applied Data Science (ADS) Project: Market Basket Analysis & Customer Segmentation
📊 Analyzing customer purchase behavior using Association Rule Mining & Machine Learning techniques.

📜 Project Overview
This project applies Market Basket Analysis (MBA) and Customer Segmentation techniques to analyze shopping patterns in a grocery store dataset. Using Apriori, FP-Growth, and AClose algorithms, we identify frequent itemsets and association rules to improve business insights. Additionally, clustering and classification models categorize customer purchasing behaviors.

📂 Repository Contents
📁 ADS_PROJECT.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, association rule mining, and clustering.
📄 ADS PROJECT.ipynb - Colab.pdf – PDF version of the Jupyter Notebook for easy reference.
📑 ADS_project.pdf – Full project report detailing methodology, results, and business impact.
📜 README.md – This file, providing an overview of the project.

🎯 Project Breakdown
🔹 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing
✔️ Cleaning & formatting the dataset
✔️ Identifying missing values and handling inconsistencies
✔️ Visualizing product frequency, customer trends, and purchase patterns

🔹 2. Market Basket Analysis (Association Rule Mining)
✔️ Apriori Algorithm – Extracts frequent itemsets based on a minimum support threshold
✔️ FP-Growth Algorithm – Faster alternative to Apriori for large datasets
✔️ AClose Algorithm – Finds closed frequent itemsets efficiently
✔️ Extracting Association Rules – Helps understand co-purchased items

📌 Example Insight: 💡 If a customer buys milk, they have a 70% probability of also buying bread.

🔹 3. Customer Segmentation & Predictive Modeling
✔️ Clustering Methods:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)
HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Clustering)
AGNES (Agglomerative Clustering)
✔️ Classification Models: Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, SVM

📈 Key Findings & Business Impact
📌 Top-Selling Products: Milk, Vegetables, Soft Drinks, Bread
📌 Peak Sales Days: Thursdays have the highest transactions
📌 Customer Segments Identified:
✔️ Casual Shoppers (21%) – Infrequent purchases
✔️ Regular Customers (70%) – Weekly buyers
✔️ Loyal Customers (9%) – Frequent high-value purchases

📌 Business Recommendations:
✅ Product Bundling: Offer discounts on frequently co-purchased items (e.g., coffee + sugar)
✅ Personalized Offers: Suggest products based on past purchases
✅ Stock Optimization: Ensure availability of high-frequency items

⚙️ Technologies Used
🔹 Programming Languages: Python
🔹 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Mlxtend (Apriori, FP-Growth)
